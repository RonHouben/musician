# Database

This folder is currenlty empty since the database runs via the
docker-compose.yml in the root directory of the repository.

This folder is still necessary so PostgreSQL has a place to safe the data in for persitency of local development.
This saved in `/apps/database/data` and will not be uploaded to the repository.

# What database is used?
PostgreSQL 15.1 via Docker
